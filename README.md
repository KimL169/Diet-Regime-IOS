Diet-Regime-IOS
==============

Diet Regime is a diet app that allows users to track their diet progress and bodycomposition changes, as well as plan diets. The App is tailored to athletes and fitness enthousiasts and allows diet planning with great precision. The user can set up cyclical diets with different dietary intakes on different days. The app will sync the diet plan with the users's diet logbook. The app will also incorporate a chart view that provides a visual display of the users progress over time, as well as the ability to add progress photos.

Furthermore the app implements a set of calory calculators that the user can adjust based on real world results so the user may more accurately fine-tune his/her diet. 

The user will be able to export his diet results to his email. Finished diet plans will be stored in an archive along with the logbook entries pertaining to that diet plan as well as the results achieved. This allows users to review their past diets and results.

The app also has a statistics section that keeps track of the users' progress towards set goals and his bodystatistics including lean body mass, bmi and average weight change per week..

The app will share data with other apps via the healthkit framework that will be included in iOS8.
